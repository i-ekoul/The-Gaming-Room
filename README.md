# The Gaming Room: CS-230 Software Design Document

### Summary of the Client and Software Requirements
The client, **The Gaming Room**, requested the development of a web-based version of their existing Android game, *Draw It or Lose It*. The objective was to create a scalable, cross-platform application that is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. Key requirements included:
- Ensuring unique identifiers for games, teams, and players.
- Maintaining a single game instance using the **Singleton pattern**.
- Supporting platform independence through responsive web design.

Additional priorities included scalability, security, and efficient resource management to deliver a robust and seamless user experience.

### Strengths in Documentation Development
The design documentation excelled in detailing the system architecture and recommending technologies that aligned with the client’s needs. Key highlights included:
- **Java** for application logic.
- **RESTful APIs** for communication.
- **MySQL** for scalable data persistence.

The use of design patterns like Singleton and Iterator ensured efficient memory management and unique entity identification. Additionally, employing **Eclipse IDE** facilitated smooth development and debugging, ensuring alignment with the structured design.

### Benefits of the Design Document Process
The design document served as a vital framework by organizing the system into a **three-tier architecture**:
1. **Presentation Tier**: User interface and client-side interactions.
2. **Application Tier**: Core game logic and API handling.
3. **Data Tier**: Persistent storage for game, team, and player data.

This structure provided a logical flow for development and addressed challenges like scalability and platform independence. The emphasis on **object-oriented principles**—such as encapsulation and inheritance—ensured a maintainable and extensible codebase.

### Areas for Improvement and Revision
One area for improvement would be enhancing the mobile development recommendations. Exploring **hybrid frameworks** such as **Flutter** or **React Native** could:
- Simplify cross-platform development.
- Reduce costs and timelines.
- Provide a unified codebase for iOS and Android platforms.

Adding a more detailed evaluation of these frameworks would strengthen the recommendations section.

### Interpretation and Implementation of User Needs
The client’s needs were met by incorporating:
- **Scalability measures** to handle concurrent users and teams.
- **Platform independence** to ensure seamless operation on any device.
- **Entity management** using the Singleton pattern for efficient memory use.

Technologies like RESTful APIs facilitated communication across devices, while MySQL ensured secure and scalable data storage. Addressing user needs is essential to balancing functionality, performance, and usability, ensuring the final product meets client expectations.

### Software Design Approach and Future Strategies
The software design process included:
- Analyzing requirements and visualizing relationships with **UML diagrams**.
- Structuring the system into a **three-tier architecture** for clarity and scalability.
- Leveraging **Eclipse IDE** for efficient coding and debugging.

In future projects, I would prioritize:
- Incorporating **iterative feedback** during the design phase.
- Using **prototyping tools** to refine user interfaces and functionality early in development.

These strategies would improve development efficiency and ensure strong alignment with client goals and user needs.
